# 🌟 Personal Portfolio Website

3. **Open the website**
   - **Option 1**: Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - **Option 2**: Use a local development server (recommended)

     Using Python:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```

     Using Node.js:
     ```bash
     npx http-server
